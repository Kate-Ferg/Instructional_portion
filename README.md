Just as a little background information, SVG stands for scalable vector graphics. SVGs are useful because they have a smaller file sizes than raster based images, will render clearly no matter the size, and can be styled using CSS.

## These steps will help you learn how to create a basic SVG animation:

1. First you will need an SVG to work with. You can either create your own digital illustration using Illustrator, or use the SVG I have preloaded into the index.html file of this project.

### For creating your own SVG:
- Open up Adobe Illustrator and create a graphic. Try to plan ahead of time how you would like your illustration to be animated. This is because each complete shape and path that you make can be animated seperately, so pay attention to each object or layer that you have. 
- You will need to save the file as an SVG so that you can get the code you will need to put into index.html. So go to File > Save As, and then select "SVG" for the format. Click "Save", and then in the next window that pops up you'll want to click the button that says "SVG Code". The code should then open up in a text editor.
- Optionally, you may want to run this code through an SVG optimiser to eliminate unneccessary information, making the code cleaner and quicker to load. To do this you can copy and paste the code into a resourece found at https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/. Just paste the code into the "Paste Markup" area and click the "copy as text" button found right above the download button.
- Now you can paste this text into the index.html file of this project (make sure you delete the code for the sample SVG that's already in here).
